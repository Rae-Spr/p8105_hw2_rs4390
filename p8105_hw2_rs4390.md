# Problem 1

``` r
transit_df = read_csv('data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv') %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))

## checking the type of variable
typeof(transit_df$entry)
```

    ## [1] "logical"

## Dataset description

The transit_df dataset contains 1868 observations of individual New York
City transit subway entrances and/or exits. There are 19 total variables
that detail the name of the transit lines b, transit station names,
station latitudes and longitudes, route numbers served, whether or not
the exit also doubles as an entrance, vending access, entrance type, and
ADA compliance. To clean the data, I used the `clean_names` function
from the `janitor` package to make all variable names lowercase and
snake_case. Then, I selected for the variables of interest listed above.
The resulting dataset has dimensions described above, which are 1868
rows x 19 columns. This dataset is now tidy because all the columns are
variables, all the rows are observations, and every value has a cell.

## How many distinct stations?

``` r
distinct_station_df = transit_df %>% 
group_by(station_name) %>% 
distinct(line)
```

There are 465 distinct stations.

## How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
ADA_comply_df = transit_df %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE)

station_ADA_df = ADA_comply_df %>% 
group_by(station_name) %>% 
distinct(line)
```

There are 84 ADA compliant stations in the dataset.

## What is the proportion of stations without vending machines that also have entry access?

``` r
no_vending_df = transit_df %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO")

entry_no_vending = no_vending_df %>% 
  filter(entry == TRUE)
  
nrow(entry_no_vending)/nrow(no_vending_df)
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Around 37.7% of stations without vending machines also have entry
access.

## Reformatting data

``` r
line_route_df = transit_df %>% 
  distinct(line, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6, route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, .keep_all = TRUE)

A_line_df = line_route_df %>% 
  filter(route1 == "A" | route2 == "A" | route3 == "A" | route4 == "A" | route5 == "A" | route6 == "A" | route7 == "A" | route8 == "A" | route9 == "A" | route10 == "A" | route11 == "A")

ADA_A_df = A_line_df %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE)
```

30 distinct stations serve the A train, and of those 14 of them are ADA
compliant.
